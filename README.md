# Pothole Detection and Smart Navigation System

This project implements a comprehensive solution for detecting potholes in road images and dynamically navigating a vehicle around them using intelligent path planning. The system integrates deep learning for pothole classification, bounding box localization, and algorithmic route planning to ensure safe and efficient traversal.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ CNN-based pothole classification
- ✅ Bounding box-based pothole localization
- ✅ CSV annotation of pothole coordinates and dimensions
- ✅ Path planning using A* algorithm to avoid potholes
- ✅ Real-time visualization of path and obstacles
- ✅ Speed and distance analytics for optimized travel
